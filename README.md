### Tools/Technologies Used <a name="tools"></a>
* Java Spring Boot and Java Spring Framework
* Postgres database
* JPA (Java Persistence API) for object-relational mapping and data persistence
* Spring Security was then installed to ensure registered user is authorized 
* JSON Web Tokens for user authentication

### Brief Summary Of Approach <a name="summary"></a>
For this project I took a very linear approach. It was easier for my to use a GitHub project board and write each step as a To-Do. Once I finished a step I pushed to my git hub and reran my server so that I didn't write too much code before testing. 

The premise was to create the models, map the models to eachother and use those relationships to write database queries. I used the ModelViewController design principle to separate the logic needed to take a user request from the database and the corresponding response. There is a Controller class that handles all of the routes, that talks to a Service class that handles all of the business logic. The Service class talks to the model repository which retrieves the information from databse using JPA. So the data is protected by many layers.  

Here is a link to my project board/to-do list. As you can see it is very long but very specific and detail oriented.
