### Tools/Technologies Used <a name="tools"></a>
* Java Spring Boot and Java Spring Framework
* Postgres database
* JPA (Java Persistence API) for object-relational mapping and data persistence
* Spring Security was then installed to ensure registered user is authorized 
* JSON Web Tokens for user authentication

### Brief Summary Of Approach <a name="summary"></a>
For this project I took a very linear approach. It was easier for my to use a GitHub project board and write each step as a To-Do. Once I finished a step I pushed to my git hub and reran my server so that I didn't write too much code before testing. 

The premise was to create the models, map the models to eachother and use those relationships to write database queries. I used the ModelViewController design principle to separate the logic needed to take a user request from the database and the corresponding response. There is a Controller class that handles all of the routes, that talks to a Service class that handles all of the business logic. The Service class talks to the model repository which retrieves the information from databse using JPA. So the data is protected by many layers.  

Here is a link to my project planning. As you can see it is very long but very specific and detail oriented.   
[Project Board/ To-Do List](#https://github.com/users/Halleywood/projects/9)

Here are all of the routes created in my API along with their type of request and functionality. 

| Request Type | URL                                    | Functionality                                                                  |

### Unsolved Problems/Hurdles <a name="problems"></a>
I had a very hard time getting my model relationships right. I had created a User and a Chicken entity, but was not saving the user_id on my Chicken entities. Once I installed Spring Security and needed to run my JPA queries with a userId, I was unable to successfully return anything because my Optional Chicken or Optional Egg was returning Null because the userId was null. That took me more time than I would like to admit to debug and solve. Once I was able to correctly link my tables, I was able to successfully query the database with a User id and an entity id.   
I also wanted to try and create a Many-To-Many relationship and make URL endpoints to retrieve that relational data. While it was a noble attempt I do not think I was successful at linking those tables properly.
